# 🚀 European Football Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes European football data to uncover trends, evaluate player and team performances, and cluster players/teams based on attributes. Using one comprehensive notebook, the analysis follows the **CRISP-DM methodology**, offering insights into the dataset.

---

## 🏆 Key Objectives
1. **Understand and clean the dataset** for analysis.
2. **Analyze player and team performances** over seasons.
3. **Apply clustering algorithms** to group players and teams.
4. **Visualize insights** with interactive graphs.

---

## 📥 Dataset
The dataset used in this project comes from **Kaggle's Soccer Database** by Hugo Mathien:
- [Soccer Database on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer?resource=download)

This SQLite database includes:
- **Player Attributes**: Rating, potential, height, weight, etc.
- **Team Metrics**: Build-up play speed, defensive aggression, passing accuracy.
- **Match Statistics**: Goals scored, possession, and more.
- **League and Country Information**.

## ⚙️ Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Management**: SQLite, Pandas
- **Visualization**: Plotly
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

📊 Steps and Methodology
1. Data Understanding and Preparation
Extract Data: Loaded data from database.sqlite, including:
Player_Attributes, Team_Attributes, Match, League, and Country.
Clean Data:
Handled missing values using mean/mode imputation.
Standardized numeric attributes like height, weight, and ratings.
2. Descriptive Analysis
Top Players: Highlighted the best performers based on a weighted performance score.
Team Metrics: Analyzed key attributes like goals, defensive metrics, and passing efficiency.
Seasonal Trends: Explored player and team performance across seasons.
3. Clustering
Player Clustering: Grouped players into:
Prolific Attackers, Robust Defenders, Balanced Midfielders.
Team Clustering: Grouped teams based on metrics like build-up speed, goals scored, and defense.
Algorithms: Used KMeans and DBSCAN for clustering.
4. Visualization
Created interactive plots using Plotly, including:
Top-performing players.
High-scoring matches.
Player and team clusters.

📈 Key Insights
Top Performers: Identified players with the highest scores across seasons.
Team Analysis: Explored dominating teams based on wins, goals scored, and defensive efficiency.
Player Clusters:
Prolific Attackers: High offensive scores.
Robust Defenders: Strong defensive metrics.
Seasonal Trends: Highlighted the evolution of team and player performance over multiple seasons.
🔍 Results and Recommendations
Player Consistency: Teams should focus on recruiting consistent players for key positions.
Team Strategies: Insights from clustering can help refine offensive and defensive tactics.
Performance Trends: Seasonal insights provide valuable data for improving training regimens.
